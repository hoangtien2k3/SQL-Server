//
- The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
    + The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

    + The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
        The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
        The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
    
    + The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

//
- AND Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

    Ex: SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';


- OR Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

    Ex: SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';


- NOT Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
